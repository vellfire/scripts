# Will's Assorted Scripts

These are some of the scripts I've worked on over the years
Some of these are specific to the industry I was working in at the time
Some of these are taken from old colleagues and changed up slightly, or refactored
There may be duplicates in here (for example, there's multiple cleanup scripts from desktop support)
